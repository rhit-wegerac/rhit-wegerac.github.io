        <p>Hi! My name is Andrew Weger, and I am currently a Senior at Rose-Hulman
          Institute of Technology. Here at Rose-Hulman, I am in the fifth year of my
          Computer Engineering Major. I took two quarters off in the fall of 2019 to 
          participate in the Disney College Program as CO-OP to give me a break from school and to de-stress, which 
          I proceeded to come back to school for only a week before they sent everyone home because of the pandemic. 
          In my spare time, when I'm not tinkering around with electronics, I enjoy playing video games, 3D printing, 
          and pen turning when I get to go home.  
        </p>
